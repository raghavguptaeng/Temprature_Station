# Temprature_Station
 Following is the software implemented in Arduino to tell the temprature outside. It is usefull in cities like Delhi to detect the temprature locally. The Led light helps to tell the reading. If the light is red, the temprature is too high. If the light is green, the temprature is moderate and if light is blue, Temprature is low.
